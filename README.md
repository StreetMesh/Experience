A collection of illustrated essays describing life in the virtual world of StreetMesh.

## About This Project

The work you find here is a subproject of the [StreetMesh Framework](https://github.com/StreetMesh/Framework). This particular project focuses on capturing ideas about what it will be like to explore a fun and functional metaverse—one that is truly decentralized, built upon open systems and protocols, and guided by user-centered design principles.

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience_design):

> User experience design (UX design, UXD, UED, or XD), upon which is the centralized requirements for "User Experience Design Research" (also known as UX Design Research), defines the experience a user would go through when interacting with a company, its services, and its products. User experience design is a user centered design approach because it considers the user's experience when using a product or platform.

Given the central role that story plays in making sense of the real world, we thought it best to begin the design of a virtual world using one of the oldest storytelling *frameworks* known to humanity: the monomyth, aka, [the hero's journey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey).

> In narratology and comparative mythology, the hero's quest or hero's journey, also known as the monomyth, is the common template of stories that involve a hero who goes on an adventure, is victorious in a decisive crisis, and comes home changed or transformed.

To accelerate this exploration, we have used the latest in "AI": Large Language Models provided by OpenAI. Embracing a core value of *Transparency*, the prompts used to generate these stories have also been added to this project.

We hope you enjoy the adventures. See you on the Street.
