*I, for one, am grateful we can connect to StreetMesh Servers without any wetware.*

Thanks entirely to billions of dollars extracted from our dwindling national attention span, we can connect to our virtual worlds for the low, low cost of a [Meta Quest](https://www.meta.com/quest/) VR headset! 

I just bought the latest model yesterday: a brand new Quest 3S. I've already worked myself through the usual onboarding crap that they make you do when you get a new one: yes, I've cleared my playspace of all obstructions; yes, I've adjusted the lens spacing; yes, I'll take breaks. Come on, I'm ready!

This all started when Tim told me about this thing called *StreetMesh*. "It's an open world in there that maps onto the world we have out here, and they're just getting started," Tim said. "Good enough," I said. "Not like GTA 6 is going to be out anytime soon, anyway." Tim said he could join me inside, and we could do *their* onboarding together.

"Yay. More onboarding. Eye-roll." 

So now I'm standing in the living room, and my Quest has booted up. I'm going to open the Store app, and download the StreetMesh Browser. It's free!

Tim said that when I run Browser, it will ask me to type in a website address, just like a web browser would. And sure enough, there it is. Now I'll enter "streetmesh.com" and hit the go button.
