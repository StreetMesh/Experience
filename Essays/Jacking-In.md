# Jacking In

Alex had always been curious about the metaverse but never enough to dive in—until now. His friend Tim wouldn’t stop talking about StreetMesh, the next evolution in online presence. After weeks of persuasion, Alex finally caved, purchasing the brand-new Meta Quest 3S, still shiny in its box.

“Trust me, it’s worth it,” Tim had said. “I’ll even onboard with you.” That promise sealed the deal. Alex unboxed the headset, slipped it on, and followed Tim’s instructions: search for ‘StreetMesh’ in the app store and download it. Browser was the portal, Tim said, the key to the entire experience.

Alex hesitated. The living room looked the same through the passthrough display—but now, floating in front of him, was a sleek virtual console suspended in air, shimmering like a dream. Across it blinked a simple prompt:
“Where do you want to go today?”

He typed in the StreetMesh address Tim had sent him: tim.streetmesh.com. Instantly, the console shimmered and transformed. On the left, a chrome-skinned robot avatar appeared.

“Welcome to Tim’s Apartment in Virtual City. Tim let me know you’d be coming. I’ve sent him a message asking him to join us.”

To the right, Tim’s avatar materialized—grinning, animated, stylized like him but slightly cooler.

“Hey buddy, welcome! You can join me in my place once you’ve logged in.”

The console now displayed a range of sign-in options: social platforms, email, even something called StreetMesh Identity. Alex chose email. Almost instantly, his phone buzzed. He pulled it out, read the code, and entered it into the virtual console.

The console faded away. In its place: a mirror. Ethereal light rippled across it, and Alex saw… himself. Or rather, a blank avatar—faceless, genderless, floating like mist.
The robot guide explained,

“This is your starting form. Use the tools in front of you to shape who you’ll be in StreetMesh.”

With Tim watching, Alex explored the controls: selecting hair, adjusting body type, customizing clothes, even playing with motion styles. It was part dress-up, part identity crafting.
When he was done, he nodded. The avatar smiled back.

A soft ding echoed.

“You’ve joined a party with Tim,” the robot said. “Since Tim joined you during onboarding, StreetMesh linked you into a party. You can leave it anytime.”

Alex looked at Tim, who grinned:

“Ready to see what a virtual domicile looks like?”

The console returned one last time, this time as a poll:

Where do you want to go next?
	•	The Train Station
	•	The Library
	•	Tim’s Apartment

Tim gestured at the last option.

“Let’s go to my apartment. I want to show you how home spaces work here.”

Alex selected it. The mixed reality passthrough dimmed—his living room fading into nothingness.

When the light returned, they were there: in a gorgeous virtual apartment, high above the skyline of Virtual City. Neon pulses lit distant towers. Airships hummed silently across a horizon of shimmering architecture. Tim’s robot hovered nearby, passive and glowing.

Alex walked to the balcony and stared out. He didn’t need to say anything.

Tim came up beside him.

“Pretty wild, right? You’ll be able to build your own spot soon. Customize it. Invite people. Host events.”

Alex nodded. This wasn’t a game. This was something deeper: a digital layer over reality, tethered by identity, relationship, and place. For the first time, he understood what Tim meant by presence in the metaverse.

Back in the real world, Alex still stood in his living room. But everything had changed. He now had a key. A home. An identity in a new world—and a friend to help him explore it.

He smiled and whispered to himself,

“Yeah... I think I’m going to like it here.”
