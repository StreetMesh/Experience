Using the simple narrative form of the heros journey, draft a story for me to illustrate the experience of onboarding into a metaverse platform called StreetMesh; make sure to include these technical details, woven into the narrative: 1. We're using the Meta Quest headset, and the protagonist just bought a new one for this purpose (a new Quest 3S); 2. The application software for accessing StreeMesh is called a "Browser" and needs to be downloaded from the app store; 3. All of this is at the behest of the protagonist's friend Tim, who has told the protagonist that he'll be able to go along for the journey of onboarding; 4. When the app starts up, it is a mixed reality experience: the protagonist can still see his living room, but in front of him is a virtual console, prompting him with a question: "Where do you want to go today?" 5. here the protagonist does as instructed, entering the "StreetMesh address" that Tim gave him: "tim.streetmesh.com"; 6. The app opens to a simple screen welcoming the protagonist. To the left of the console appears an avatar that looks like a robot and welcomes our protagonist to "Tim's Apartment in Virtual City." "Tim let me know you would be coming, I've sent him a message asking him to join us." 7. To the right of the console appears Tim's avatar: "Hey buddy, welcome! You can join me in my place once you've logged in." 8. Turning his attention to the console, the protagonist now notes options for sign into StreetMesh: options include a collection of social media platforms, the option to use just an email address, and even an option to "Sign in using StreetMesh Identity". 9. The protagonist chooses email address, and his phone buzzes in his pocket. He pulls it out, reads the code, and enters it into the virtual console. 10. The console is replaced with a mirror. In the mirror the protagonist sees his reflection: it is ethereal, faceless, genderless, ready to take form. The robot explains that this is a starting point, and that our protagonist should use the tools in front of him to build his Avatar for StreetMeshâ€”one, he's sure, of many. Tim looks on as our protagonist experiments with the tools, and ultimately confirming his selections, takes ownership of his first Avatar. 11. Next, a notification appears on the screen: "You have joined a party with Tim." The robot explains that StreetMesh has put you into a party with Tim because he joined you during Onboarding, and that you can leave the party anytime you wish. 12. Then, a prompt: Where do you want to go next? The options appear as a poll questionnaire: the Train Station, the Library, Tim's apartment. Tim says, "Let's go to my apartment, I want to show you how domiciles work in this Virtual World." 13. The protagonist agrees and makes his selection. The view of the protagonist's real world living room becomes dim and then dark. When the lights come back on, the protagonist and Tim and his robot are standing together in a virtual world: a beautiful apartment in a high rise overlooking a sprawling city. The protagonist delights in the view: he thinks he's going to like it here.
