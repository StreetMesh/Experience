Using the simple narrative form of the heros journey, draft a story for me to illustrate the experience inside of Winchester: the first city to adopt StreetMesh for its digital twin. The story should follow an unnamed male protagonist who goes for a walk in Old Town: a two-block long street lined with restaurants, coffee shops, and speciality stores. It should include stopping to listen to buskers play, and tipping them for their tunes. It should include having a virtual beer at the British Pub with mates visiting the virtual world from physical far reaching places (like Hungary), and watching a live stream of the football game being played in London. It should come to rest playing a chess game outside under the trees that line the streets.
